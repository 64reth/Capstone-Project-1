<p>Dear Sir/Madame,</p>
<p>
  I am the Technical Administrator for The Royal Society for the encouragement
  of Arts,Manufactures and Commerce. I joined the RSA in 2022 after wanting to
  seek new challenges and I have gained a wealth of experience both in
  regenerative thinking and initiatives that foster true social impact but also
  in strategic analysis, planning and execution.
</p>
<p>
  Having spent over 15 years working in education and youth provision as a Youth
  Worker, Learning Mentor and a Learning Support Coordinator at a West London
  college. I was contacted about the role for Head of Inclusive Learning Support
  by a recruitment agency as my experience and employment history shows the
  strength of my background in education. I am a friendly, well presented and
  professional colleague with a genuine personality. I have an enormous creative
  streak and I seek to empower and inspire others.
</p>
<p>
  I took a step away from education to find new challenges and gain high level
  perspective in a role that required technical ability and a wide range of
  transferable skills that helped me to stand out and progress through my
  current organisation.
</p>
<p>
  With the experience I have gained project managing, streamlining and rolling
  out systems I believe I have gained further vital skills that I can bring to
  the role of Head of Inclusive Learning Support in my ability to analyse the
  needs of the organisation, effectively strategise solutions and
  comprehensively plan to bring about the best possible outcome to help the
  college reach its targets
</p>
<p>
  I would describe my approach to work as methodical with an eye for detail. I
  strive to get things right but can also be very adaptable to the situation at
  hand. My CV details the assets I bring to any work environment and I have been
  seen by employers and management as a valuable colleague who is reliable,
  ambitious and able to upwardly progress through an organisation. I have a
  proven record of getting results and working to enhance the team dynamic while
  providing excellent service to both clients and outside agencies in
  collaboration.
</p>
<p>
  Thank you for your consideration and I would appreciate you reaching out to
  discuss any potential roles you think are suitable.
  <br />
  <p>Yours sincerely,<br /></p>
  Gareth Allen
</p>
