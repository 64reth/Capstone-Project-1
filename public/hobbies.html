  I love FPS games (first person shooters) such as Destiny and the Call of Duty
  franchise and I play regularly online with my friends. I also love action
  adventure games and RPG;s like Baldur's Gate. I regularly follow games media

  My other passion is music production, I create music in multiple genres from
  Grime nd Hip Hop to RnB. My biggest music placements have been producing
  tracks feturing Grime legend Wiley. I have also created music for BBC radio
  and Channel 4
